VITCCMozilla is a club functioning under Mozilla Tamilnadu.

We believe in keeping the power of web in people’s hands. We envision a world where web is free and fair.

We are a bunch of high spirited folks. We are a team.

You and me. We and us.

We are new, bountiful and infinite. We are a fresh generation of thinkers, movers and shakers. And we hope to succeed in our first attempt.

Bleed. Flow. And remember to code.

Let’s get rid of the asterixes.

Join us!!

Buckle up for your journey into the world of open source.
